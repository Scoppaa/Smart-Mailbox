# Smart-Mailbox
A Mailbox that Remotely Locks and Sends Notifications

This project created for Senior Capstone at Oakland University adds a raspberry pi to a standard mailbox to make it "Smart." The project was created with a team over a semester time.

This mailbox can detect motion (using rpi motion sensor) and send an SMS text message to the user that motion was detected in the mailbox. It also hooks into the Blynk app to allow you to remotely control the electromagnetic lock mounted on the mailbox. When your mail is delivered for the day, you can lock your mailbox to secure the contents until you can retrieve the mail.
